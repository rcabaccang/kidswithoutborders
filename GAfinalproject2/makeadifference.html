		<h3 class="h3center">Hand Me Up</h3>
		<p>Brand new clothes bring hope, self-esteem and dignity - so KWB collects NEW surplus children products (clothes, toys, school supplies) from retailers and manufacturers. These donated products are then distributed to children and families who live in poverty, are ill, or victims of accidents or natural disasters. 
		KWB partners with Kids In Distressed Situations (KIDS) to donate to different organizations, like the Ronald McDonald House in Seattle, Washington. KWB youth volunteers collect, sort and pack donations, as well as, identify recipients in their own communities and in many developing countries worldwide.  <a class="links" href="http://kidswithnoborders.blogspot.com/search?q=Hand+Me+Up" target="window">Read more</a></p>

		<h3 class="h3center">Miracle Baby</h3>
		<p>Now 3 years old, Thien Nhan was abandoned at birth in Viet Nam and mauled by wild animals. Dubbed ‘The Miracle Baby’, Thien Nhan was found more than three days after being abandoned in a forest. Doctors managed to save his life, but not his right leg or genitals. KWB, along with several non-government organizations, support his medical treatment. <a class="links" href="http://kidswithnoborders.blogspot.com/search?q=Miracle+Baby" target="window">Read more</a></p>
